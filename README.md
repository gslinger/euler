Project Euler Solutions. Python and some R [WIP]

The R solutions are very old. The Python solutions I am updating and adding too. 

Disclaimer: I am not some number theory whizz so in a lot of cases I will be brute forcing. After solving the problem
I will look into the mathematical theory and sometimes add additional solutions, assuming I understand how they work ;).
